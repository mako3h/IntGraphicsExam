# Intermediate Graphics Final Exam<br>
<br>
# Pre-Exam Incorporated<br>
All of the things that I added before the exam began are in a folder named "ExamSetup".  It is very organized with three folder within that (Materials, Shaders and Assets). I have a scene named "PreExam" that visually shows what I added. The actual exam pracical will be made within a scene named "Exam". <br>
Colin was asked within the discord if this was fine and he believes it was fine as we were allowed to do it within the midterm. I am communicating each thing I added into the unity project below. <br>
<br>
**Shaders Implemented:**<br>
- Bloom (This was the bloom shader implemented from the lecture. I editted this so that there is a "blur" variable)\
- Depth of Field (This shader was made from the lecture)
- LUT (This is the LUT shader that was made in the lecture. I have the neutral LUT asset png that was given to us in class too)
- Color Shadow (This was a color shadow shader that we were given in a tutorial)
- Lined Shadow (We made this in a tutorial. We had to edit the colored shadow (one above) to work as a line shadow)
- Glass (This shader was made/given in a lecture)
- Decals (This shader was made within a lecture)
- ToonRamp (This shader was given to us during a lecture. THis shader is editted so that there is rim lighting and bump maps)
- Water (This is the main water shader we made in class. I added the foam shader qualities so that this implemented shader works like normal but has foam and bump)
- Outline (This was the shader that we made in class. This shader is editted so that there is also rim lighting and toon ramps attached)
- Normal Map (This is the normal map shader made in class. This is editted to have bump added along with being able to change to colour of the texture)
<br>
**C# Scripts Implemented:**<br>
- Bloom (The one we made within class to attach to the camera)
- Depth of Field (The one we made within class to attach to the camera)
- Screen Camera Shader (I made this within the first assignment to ensure that the lut is able to work. It is attached onto the camera)
- Decals (This was created in a lecture to allow the decals shader to be toggled on/off)
<br>
**Materials Made (I am just going to put points down instead of explaining each):**<br>
- Colored Shadow Material
- Glass Material
- LUT Material
- Normal Map Material
- ToonRamp Material
- Outline Material
- Water Wave Material
<br>
**Assets Implemented:**<br>
(All normal maps were made using this website https://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/)
- Grass Texture (Made myself)
- Grass Normal Map (Made using the website)
- Glass Texture (Made myself)
- Glass Normal Map (Made using the website)
- Ice Texture (Made myself)
- Ice Normal Map (Made using the website)
- Water Texture (Was given to us in a lecture)
- Water Foam (Was given to us in a lecture)
- Water Normal Map (Was given to us in a lecture)
- 3D Modelled Monkey .obj (This was taken from blender as it is one of their prefabs. I am only using this within the PreExam Scene where I have all of this stored. Does nothing for the porject other than helping me visually articulate what I have within the unity file)
- Two Ramp Textures (One is white to blue. The other is Black to white. Both made by myself)
- Neutral LUT (This was given in a lecture. Acts as a base for making custom LUT's)
- Shadow Lines Texture (Given to me in a tutorial where we had to make lined shadows)<br>
<br>
THIS IS ALL THAT WAS ADDED PRE-EXAM. I DID NOT WORK ON ANYTHING FOR THE EXAM. THIS WAS SIMPLY TO BE ORGANIZED SO THAT ONCE THE EXAM BEGINS, I CAN FOCUS ON SOLELY APPLYING MY SKILLS.
